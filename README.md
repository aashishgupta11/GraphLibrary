# Graph Library

A versatile C++ graph library for working with graphs efficiently.

---

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: Support for directed and undirected graphs, with or without weights.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Includes DFS, BFS, topological sort, and finding strongly connected components.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree.
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path.
- **Maximum Flow**: Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for finding the maximum flow.
- **Graph Serialization**: Serialize and deserialize graphs to/from files.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-library.git
```

### Usage

1. **Include the Library**: Add `GraphLibrary.h` to your project:

   ```cpp
   #include "GraphLibrary.h"
   ```

2. **Create a Graph Object**: Initialize a `Graph` object with desired properties:

   ```cpp
   Graph graph(10, true, true);  // Example: Directed weighted graph with 10 vertices
   ```

3. **Utilize Graph Functions**: Use the provided functions to interact with the graph.

---

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "GraphLibrary.h"

int main() {
    // Create a directed graph with 5 vertices
    Graph graph(5, true);

    // Add directed edges
    graph.addDirectedEdge(0, 1);
    graph.addDirectedEdge(0, 2);
    graph.addDirectedEdge(1, 3);
    graph.addDirectedEdge(2, 3);
    graph.addDirectedEdge(3, 4);

    // Print the graph
    std::cout << "Graph:\n";
    graph.printGraph();

    // Check if the graph has cycles
    if (graph.isCyclic()) {
        std::cout << "The graph contains cycles.\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "The graph is acyclic.\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
